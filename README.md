üöÄ Mission: Mars Deployment - CI/CD Challenge üåå
Mission Briefing
Congratulations, engineer! You have been selected as the Lead DevOps Engineer for SpaceX MarsOps, a team responsible for deploying the first-ever Martian CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Application. Your task is to set up a fully automated CI/CD pipeline that ensures our Mission Control CRUD System (a simple CRUD app) is always built, tested, and packaged properly.

However, the mission has strict compliance, reliability, and automation requirements! You must ensure:

1. Code is always tested before packaging
2. Builds are automated and optimized

üõ†Ô∏è Mission Tasks

üö¶ Phase 1: Mission Repository Initialization

Create a Git repository for your project (GitHub).
Create and add a simple CRUD application that manages space station resource stock (e.g., product name, id, quantity ) using a relational or NoSQL database (preferably in-memory) and exposes the required REST endpoints.
Supported stacks: Flask/Django, Node.js (Express), Java (Spring Boot), DBs: SQLite, H2, MongoDB etc.
Ensure the application runs locally and document the setup in a README.md.
Push the code to your repository.

üöÄ Phase 2: CI - Mission Safety Checks
Goal: Ensure the mission code is always tested and reviewed before proceeding to the next phase.

Choose a CI/CD tool (GitHub Actions).
Implement automated checks:
Code Quality Check using ESLint/PyLint/Checkstyle.
Unit Tests with Jest, PyTest, or JUnit.
Configure branch protection rules:
Only merge changes into the main branch after passing checks.
Mission Success Criteria:
Every code commit triggers a CI pipeline that performs tests and quality checks.

üö¢ Phase 3: Build Automation - The Martian Compiler
Goal: Automate the application build process to ensure a deployable artifact.

Use a build automation tool:
Java ‚Üí Use Maven/Gradle to generate a .jar file.
Python ‚Üí Use setup.py and package the app.
Node.js ‚Üí Use webpack or npm build.
Dockerize the application:
Write a Dockerfile to package the app.
Build the Docker image and store it in Docker Hub (ensure the confidentiality of your docker credentials by storing them as GitHub secrets).
Mission Success Criteria:
The CI pipeline automatically builds and stores a deployable artifact.

üéØ Bonus Challenge: Intergalactic Infrastructure as Code (IaC) + Simple UI
(Optional, for extra credit!)

Use Docker Compose to automate local environment setup.
Create a very simple UI (JavaScript-based, using React, Vue, or plain HTML/CSS/JS) to interact with the CRUD application.
Docker Compose the frontend with the backend (CRUD App), ensuring they run together seamlessly.
üõ†Ô∏è Mission Tasks' Documentation
Mission 1
Here‚Äôs a brief setup guide for developers cloning your repository, mars-app-CI-CD-SEIP:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/DimiChatzipavlis/mars-app-CI-CD-SEIP.git

Navigate to the project directory: cd mars-app-CI-CD-SEIP

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Create the database: python create_database.py

Run the application: python app.py

Access the API: Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/resources in a browser or API tool.

Note: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

Mission 2
We make a CI/CD tool with Github Actions. We write the main.yml file, update the requirements.txt file with pytest and configure branch protection rules. For the code quality check we use pylint.

Mission 3
We write the python automation tool with the setup.py file. Afterwards, we create an appropiate docker file. Lastly, we update the main.yml file.
Use Docker Compose to automate local environment setup.
Create a very simple UI (JavaScript-based, using React, Vue, or plain HTML/CSS/JS) to interact with the CRUD application.
Docker Compose the frontend with the backend (CRUD App), ensuring they run together seamlessly.
Mission Success Criteria:
The entire application stack (UI + Backend + Database) can be started with one command using Docker Compose!
The UI provides a basic interface for users to perform CRUD operations on the backend.
